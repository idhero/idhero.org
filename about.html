				<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In the situation when a government is unstable, corrupt or non-existent, verifying one's identity to access financial services becomes a challenging problem. idhero substitutes the role of central authority in providing ID, and permits users to claim their identity via the social networks of friends, family and co-workers. </p>

<p>Imagine an entrepreneur living in a rural area of West Africa, who never received a birth certificate, or a Syrian refugee, whose passport got stolen by the human traffickers. In both cases, these are productive members of society, who can take out a loan and invest money in a meaningful way. However, they cannot do so because of no personal identification. </p>

<p>The case of Nigeria, a comparatively more developed country for the West African region, demonstrates the usefulness of idhero. Last year, Nigerian government in partnership with Mastercard launched an ID card that doubles as a pre-paid card to increase accessibility to banking services. However, even this award-winning and revolutionary program will leave 60 million citizens without an ID in the foreseeable future.  At the same time Nigeria has 107% telephone penetration, meaning it boasts 7% more active phone numbers than citizens, offering an opportunity to use the mobile phone platform for filling the void in the government services. </p>

<h2>Business Case</h2>
<p>idhero solves the problem of identification by leveraging data from social ties that every person has. It uses the most rudimentary, cross-platform and agile way to extract the data - SMS. The user creates a personal profile on the idhero network, and other members of the network upvote the new user to verify the truthfulness of his personal information. After the new users build their 'personal credit,' they can provide the data to a bank, which will now has more information to approve or reject the loan.</p> 

<p>idhero increase financial inclusion in developing countries by putting together as much supporting information as possible for obtaining a loan. The idea acknowledges that personal identification in conditions with weak government might not be fully reliable, but the probability of truthfulness can get high enough to give the person a loan. The information from idhero can be revolutionary for providing microloans, which involve lower risk for the bank due to their small size.</p>

<p>Once the network is large enough, the data can be stored in a distributed database to empower people in managing their data. The users can choose what data they would like to include and change the data as they want. They share the data with others through two commands allowing temporary (SHARE) and permanent (GIVE) access to data. </p>

<p>idhero has the potential to become a unified ID system with dynamic amount of information, accessible from anywhere where SMS messaging is available. Because the users have a natural incentive to get their profile verified with other users, idhero is predisposed to collect large enough data samples on each person to become a highly-reliable way for people to wage each other's identity. </p>

<h2>UI/UX</h2>
<p>Our team grew up in a high-technology environment, so thinking about how users in less developed countries will use our service was an interesting issue. We drew a lot of information from our experience in working with people in Zaatari, a refugee camp in Jordan, and Dharavi, the second-largest slum in Asia. </p>

<p>We decided to use ubiquitous SMS technology, which makes the service cross-platform and universally accessible. All keywords used during the registration are the same as natural language to make the interaction instinctive and reduce friction with autocorrect. Twilio API supports Unicode characters, so any part of the system can be easily translated into non-latin languages. </p>

<p>idhero's accessibility naturally increases as the manufacturers of phone interfaces account for more disabilities. Relying on text messaging, the current implementation of idhero has a strong visual component. However, it is very exciting that accessibility for the visually impaired people can be easily improved by introducing a version that involves voice calling rather than texting. </p>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>idhero is built with Twilio API, a NodeJS server and a MongoDB database. Because it uses text messages for interfacing, it is fully cross-platform. It offers a web interface that the bank can use to retrieve user information built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Speed of Implementation</h2>
<ul>
<li>The minimum viable product can be deployed instantly. It has the following functionalities:</li>
<li>Create a new user.</li>
<li>Verify the user by a person who is already in the network.</li>
<li>Share your ID information - temporarily or permanently.</li>
<li>Future functionalities include:</li>
<li>Further gamification.</li>
<li>Ranking of individual profile items.</li>
<li>Block chain for additional verification.</li>
<li>More and more and more superheroes!</li>
<li>and more...</li>
